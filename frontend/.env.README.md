# Frontend Environment Variables

## Setup

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` to set your authentication password:
   ```
   VITE_AUTH_PASSWORD=your_password_here
   ```

## Environment Variables

- `VITE_AUTH_PASSWORD`: The static password for authentication. Default: `bananfalk`

## Important Notes

- The `.env` file is gitignored and will not be committed to version control
- Environment variables in Vite must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in client code
- After changing `.env`, you must restart the dev server for changes to take effect
- For production deployments, set environment variables using your hosting platform's environment variable configuration

## Security

> **Warning**: This implementation uses a static password for demonstration purposes only. For production use, implement proper authentication with:
> - Backend authentication API
> - Secure password hashing
> - JWT tokens or session management
> - HTTPS enforcement
